    <h1 style="text-align: center;"><u>DESERTS</u></h1>
    <p>A desert is a barren area of landscape where little precipitation occurs and, consequently, living conditions are
        hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to
        denudation. About one-third of the land surface of the Earth is arid or semi-arid. This includes much of the
        polar regions, where little precipitation occurs, and which are sometimes called polar deserts or "cold
        deserts". Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, by the temperature that prevails,
        by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location.</p>

            Deserts have been defined and classified in a number of ways, generally combining total precipitation,
            number of
            days on which this falls, temperature, and humidity, and sometimes additional factors. For example,
            Phoenix,
            Arizona, receives less than 250 mm (9.8 in) of precipitation per year, and is immediately recognized as
            being
            located in a desert because of its aridity-adapted plants. The North Slope of Alaska's Brooks Range also
            receives less than 250 mm (9.8 in) of precipitation per year and is often classified as a cold desert.
            Other
            regions of the world have cold deserts, including areas of the Himalayas[24] and other high-altitude
            areas in
            other parts of the world. Polar deserts cover much of the ice-free areas of the Arctic and
            Antarctic. A non-technical definition is that deserts are those parts of Earth's surface that have
            insufficient vegetation cover to support a human population. </dd>

        </dt>
        <dd>
            People have been living in deserts for millennia. Many, such as the Bushmen in the Kalahari, the
            Aborigines in
            Australia and various tribes of North American Indians, were originally hunter-gatherers. They
            developed
            skills
            in the manufacture and use of weapons, animal tracking, finding water, foraging for edible plants
            and
            using the
            things they found in their natural environment to supply their everyday needs. Their self-sufficient
            skills and
            knowledge were passed down through the generations by word of mouth. Other cultures developed a
            nomadic
            way
            of life as herders of sheep, goats, cattle, camels, yaks, llamas or reindeer. They travelled over
            large
            areas
            with their herds, moving to new pastures as seasonal and erratic rainfall encouraged new plant
            growth.
            They took
            with them their tents made of cloth or skins draped over poles and their diet included milk, blood
            and
            sometimes
            meat.

    <h2><u>DESERT RANGES IN PAKISTAN</u></h2>
    <p>Nature has blessed Pakistan with unique landscape, the high mountains; plateau plain, deserts and luring
        sunny
        beaches are found here. Pakistan is an amazing country for tourism in every aspect. Owing to its immense
        natural
        beauty, the country has also recently been accredited as the world’s top tourist destination for 2020. The
        uniqueness of Pakistan’s topography is also backed by the fact that around 10% of its total land has been
        covered with different types of barren lands, commonly known as deserts. Found in different regions across
        the
        country, the deserts of Pakistan are best-known for their unique features, which also differentiates them
        from
        each other. We are going to explore some interesting facts about these extremely vast and mysterious barren
        lands of Pakistan.</p>


    <p>Pakistan hosts five deserts which were historically forests. They include:</p>
