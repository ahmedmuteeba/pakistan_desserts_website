    <h1>Thar Desert in Pakistan</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The Thar Desert spans an area of 175,000 square kilometers and covers large areas of Pakistan and India. It is
        the largest desert of Pakistan and the only subtropical desert of Asia. It is the 16th largest desert on the
        planet and the third largest in Asia. It has also spread into India. The Thar Desert, also known as the Great
        Indian Desert, is a large, arid region in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent that forms a natural
        boundary between India and Pakistan. It is the world's 16th largest desert, and the world's 9th largest
        subtropical desert. 85% of the Thar Desert is in India, and the remaining 15% is in Pakistan. In India, it
        covers 320,000 km2 (120,000 sq mi), of which 90% is in Rajasthan and extends into Gujarat, Punjab, and Haryana.
        In Pakistan, it spreads over Punjab and Sindh starting from Tharparkar District in the east. This desert
        consists of a very dry part, the Marusthali region, in the west, and a semi-desert region in the east with fewer
        sand dunes and slightly more precipitation. </p>
